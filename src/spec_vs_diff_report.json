  "summary": "The diff implements grouped browsing on the Hub page: when \"All Categories\" is selected, games are filtered by the existing search query, grouped by `game.category`, and rendered as separate category sections with headings that hide when empty. When a specific category is selected, it renders a single grid of the filtered games. The results count reflects the filtered set, and game cards preserve category/difficulty/tags and Play/Coming Soon behavior via a composed `GameCard` component.",
