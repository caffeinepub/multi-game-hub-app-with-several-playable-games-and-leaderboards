  "summary": "Diff implements expanded game registry metadata (tags/difficulty), hub discovery controls (search + category filter), and displays new metadata across Hub, Game Shell, and All Leaderboards. It also includes styling changes aimed at keeping the hub grid readable at larger scales. Registry validation is claimed in summaries but is not directly visible in the truncated `gameRegistry.ts` snippet.",
